# WebSailor Clarification

## Important Discovery
WebSailor is not a simple web research API as initially assumed. It's actually an advanced AI agent model developed by Alibaba NLP that requires deployment and infrastructure setup.

## What WebSailor Actually Is
- An "agentic search model" from the WebAgent project
- A Large Language Model (LLM) specifically trained for web navigation and information seeking
- Requires model deployment (WebSailor-7B, WebSailor-72B variants)
- Part of a research project with models "coming soon" as of 2025

## Required Dependencies
If you want to use WebSailor, you need:
1. Model deployment infrastructure
2. Google Search API (SerpAPI or Serper)
3. Jina Reader API for content extraction
4. DashScope API
5. Significant compute resources for model inference

## Recommended Alternative
For production use, we recommend using a simpler approach:
1. **Google Search API (SerpAPI)** - For finding relevant web pages
2. **Jina Reader API** - For extracting clean content from URLs
3. **GPT-4 or Claude API** - For analyzing and structuring the information

This approach provides similar functionality without the complexity of deploying and maintaining a specialized AI model.

## Implementation Pattern
```python
# Simple web research without WebSailor
async def research_person(name: str, company: str):
    # 1. Search Google via SerpAPI
    search_results = serp_api.search(f"{name} {company} LinkedIn")
    
    # 2. Extract content from top URLs via Jina
    contents = []
    for url in search_results[:5]:
        content = jina_reader.extract(url)
        contents.append(content)
    
    # 3. Analyze with GPT-4/Claude
    structured_data = ai_model.analyze(contents)
    
    return structured_data
```

This provides the same end result with much simpler deployment and maintenance.
