## Campaign Microtargeting System

This project implements a fully automated and secure system for enriching contact data, specifically designed for political campaign microtargeting. It leverages a multi-component pipeline to gather comprehensive information from diverse online sources.

The system ingests basic contact details and performs intelligent web research, including identity verification, broad signal discovery, and specialized social media/database queries. All collected data is then synthesized using AI to generate nuanced insights and structured tags for effective campaign segmentation.
