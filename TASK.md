### Deep Research Prompt: Optimal Tooling for Campaign Microtargeting Pipeline

**Objective:** To identify the most suitable and cost-effective tools for each component of our campaign microtargeting data enrichment pipeline, considering features, pricing, scalability, and integration capabilities.

**Output Format:** A comprehensive comparison table, followed by a summary recommendation for each pipeline component.

---

**Research Steps & Data Collection:**

For each tool/service listed below, perform the following research:

1.  **Identify Core Functionality:** What is the primary purpose and key features of the tool?
2.  **Pricing Model:** How is the service priced (e.g., per query, per GB, per month, per minute)?
3.  **Estimated Cost for Our Scale:** Attempt to estimate the cost for a hypothetical volume (e.g., 1,000 contacts per month, assuming 5 SERP queries per contact, 10 content extractions per contact). State any assumptions made.
4.  **Pros for Our Project:** List specific advantages relevant to our campaign microtargeting goals (e.g., anti-blocking, LLM-ready output, structured data, n8n integration, specific signal extraction).
5.  **Cons for Our Project:** List specific disadvantages (e.g., high cost at scale, slow, limited features, complex integration, not designed for our use case).
6.  **Integration with n8n:** Is there a native n8n node, a community node, or does it require a generic HTTP request?
7.  **Suite Integration:** Is it part of a larger platform that offers other components of our pipeline (e.g., Bright Data offers SERP, Web Scraper, People Data)?
8.  **Identify and Research Competitors:** For each category, actively search for and include any other significant competitors or highly relevant tools that are not already on this list. Add them to the research and comparison.

**Tool Categories & Specific Tools to Research:**

**A. Component 1: Identity Anchoring (People Data APIs)**
*   Bright Data (investigate if they have a direct People Data API or partner)
*   PeopleDataLabs
*   Spokeo
*   BeenVerified
*   *Actively search for other relevant People Data APIs.*

**B. Component 2: Multi-Vector Signal Discovery (Broad Search & Content Extraction)**
    *   **Combined SERP + Content Tools:**
        *   Jina Reader
        *   Firecrawl (specifically its "Search API" and content cleaning)
        *   *Actively search for other tools that combine SERP and content extraction.*
    *   **Dedicated SERP APIs (for Broad Discovery):**
        *   Bright Data SERP API
        *   SerpApi
        *   Oxylabs (SERP API offerings)
        *   ScraperAPI (SERP capabilities)
        *   *Actively search for other dedicated SERP API providers.*
    *   **Dedicated Content Extraction/Cleaning (for Deep Analysis from URLs):**
        *   Bright Data Web Scraper API
        *   Firecrawl (specifically its "Scrape API" and LLM Extraction)

        *   *Actively search for other specialized social media scraping APIs.*
    *   **FEC Data:** (Note: This is likely a direct API call to `fec.gov`, not a third-party service, but confirm if any of the above offer a wrapper).

**D. General Web Scraping/Proxy Services (as alternatives/underlying tech):**
    *   Smartproxy (Decodo)
    *   Zyte
    *   NetNut
